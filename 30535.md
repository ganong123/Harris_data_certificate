# Data and Programming for Public Policy I

[Link to current page for reference](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/programs-degrees/courses/data-and-programming-public-policy-i)

This course is the first in the [Harris Certificate in Data Analytics](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/design-your-path/certificates/certificate-data-analytics) sequence. 

Students in this class will work with popular open-source languages as they learn both the fundamentals of good programming, and the wide range of skills needed to work with real-world data. This course will go beyond the fitting of statistical or econometric models learned in other courses, to focus on all the work that goes into finding, joining, cleaning, describing, and plotting data before it can be easily analyzed with statistics.

Among the goals for this course is the preparing of students for summer internships working with data.

The course can be taken stand-alone, but is best served by continuing onto the other courses in the Harris Certificate in Data Analytics. Beginning in Spring 2020, the course will be offered in two languages across different sections:

  * The section taught by Peter Ganong will use the R language
  * The sections taught by Jeffrey Levy will use the Python language

For more on the choice of language, see the information on the Certificate in Data Analytics page.
